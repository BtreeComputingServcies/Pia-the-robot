"# pia-the-robot"

This project was inspired by the youtube intereview between Pixar's Alonso Martinez and Sean with 'Tested'.

Since I thought this was such a cool project, I decided to design my own and gather as much information from the video as I could.

The little robot is head consists of
1) Two 3D printed concentric sphere shells using PLA plastic.
2) 3 small servos ($6.00 each)
3) 3D printed gimble system 
4) A raspberry pi 3 (or Pi zero) and camera ($35 + $30)
5) Adafruit's 16-Channel 12-bit PWM/Servo Driver ($15)
5) Adafruit's Circuit Playground Express (because it has a lot of sensors, NeoPixels, speaker, sound sensor, light sensor, termistor (Temperature sensor),  Motion Sensor, Infrared receiver/transmittor) and more on a 2" cicular board for $25.00

Included in this project are:
1) The complete Trimble SketchUp model I designed 
2) The STL generated from the SketchUp model for printing on a 3D printer
3) The python and Circuit Python code that was written to run on the raspberry pi and Circuit Playground Express.
4) * Diagrams how to wire this up.
5) * A drive image (*.img) containing the latest raspbian OS, all installed dependencies including OpenCV used for the image/face recongnition.

* Not ready yet.
